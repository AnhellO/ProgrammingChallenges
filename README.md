Programming Challenges And Algorithms
=====================================

Algorithms, attemps and solutions to some programming challenges and online judges. 
My trip to ACM - ICPC Contests:

1.- Do not copy/paste the code. At least try to understand the algorithm, study it, and implement it by yourself

2.- Some of my solutions are explained, but there are some that not (actually more than the explained problems). If you have any question about how I solved a problem, or about my algorithms or my way to solve a problem, feel free to ask :)

3.- Try to study and search from books and the Internet, algorithms and methods to solve competitive programming challenges
